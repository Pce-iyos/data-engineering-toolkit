## Documentation: Learning Git and GitHub

This project also serves as a hands-on way to **learn Git and GitHub**.  
Topics weâ€™ll practice include:
- Initializing and cloning repositories  
- Using `.gitignore` files  
- Working with branches 
- Making commits   
- Opening Pull Requests (PRs) and handling code reviews  
- Merging branches  

Helpful resources:  
- [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/)  
- [Git & GitHub Tutorial for Beginners (YouTube)](https://www.youtu.be/tRZGeaHPoaw?si=ejYyApyAoFSwWIW)

## Code Examples
```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({
    "name": ["John", "James", "Peace"],
    "value": [10, 5, 10]
})

print(df)

```
